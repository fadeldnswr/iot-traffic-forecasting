# Internet of Things Traffic Prediction with ARIMA and LSTM
## üìä Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic patterns using IoT data and advanced machine learning techniques, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The goal is to forecast traffic conditions in real-time, providing valuable insights for urban planning, traffic management, and optimization.

## üöó Problem Statement
With the rapid advancement of IoT technology, real-time traffic monitoring can be achieved using sensors connected to IoT devices. In this project, we utilize 3 ESP32 devices and a Raspberry Pi as a gateway to collect and transmit traffic sensor data to a central system.

However, a significant challenge in IoT systems lies in predicting key metrics that affect network performance, such as latency, packet loss, throughput, and power consumption. These metrics are crucial for ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of IoT systems, especially in applications that require real-time communication.

By leveraging two predictive modeling approaches, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), this project aims to forecast the performance of the IoT network based on historical data. Accurate predictions of these metrics will provide valuable insights into connection quality, enabling optimized resource usage within the IoT system, specifically for traffic surveillance applications.
