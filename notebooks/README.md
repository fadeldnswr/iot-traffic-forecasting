# Notebooks
This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used for sandboxing, experimentation, and analysis related to the IoT Traffic Prediction with ARIMA and LSTM project. It serves as the primary environment for developing, testing, and refining the ARIMA and LSTM models, as well as performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the traffic data.
## Contents
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Notebook for exploring and visualizing the traffic data.
  - Includes various data cleaning steps, summary statistics, and visualizations to understand the underlying patterns and distributions in the dataset.

2. ARIMA Model Sandbox
  - Notebook focused on building and testing the ARIMA model for predicting key traffic-related metrics like latency, packet loss, throughput, and power consumption.
  - Includes hyperparameter tuning, residual analysis, and forecasting with ARIMA.

3. LSTM Model Sandbox
  - Notebook dedicated to building and testing the LSTM model for more complex traffic prediction tasks.
  - Explores data preprocessing, model architecture, and training the LSTM on time series data for better long-term predictions.

## Purpose
These notebooks provide an experimental environment for iterating over different models and approaches to refine the predictions of traffic metrics. The goal is to test both traditional time series models (ARIMA) and modern deep learning models (LSTM) to assess their effectiveness in forecasting IoT network performance.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open any notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed (refer to requirements.txt).
- Run through the notebooks to explore data, test models, and visualize results.

Feel free to modify and experiment with different approaches and hyperparameters!
